Let's use SQL as an example, specifically sqlite

```{r}
library(DBI)
library(RSQLite)

rm(list = ls())

con = dbConnect(SQLite(), dbname = "../data/survey.db")
```

# SQL Directly

```
```{sql connection=con}
SELECT * from Person;
```
```

```{sql connection=con}
SELECT * from Person;
```

# Save SQL results into an R Variable

```
```{sql connection=con, output.var=df_sql}
SELECT * from Person;
```
```

```{sql connection=con, output.var=df_sql}
SELECT * from Person;
```

```{r}
df_sql
```

# Use an R Variable in SQL Querry

```{r}
name = 'William'
```

```
```{sql connection=con, output.var=df_sql}
SELECT * from Person WHERE personal = ?name;
```
```

```{sql connection=con, output.var=df_sql}
SELECT * from Person WHERE personal = ?name
```

```{r}
df_sql
```
